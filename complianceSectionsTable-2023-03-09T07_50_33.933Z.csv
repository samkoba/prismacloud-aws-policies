"Practice Cloud Financial Management","With the adoption of cloud, technology teams innovate faster due to shortened approval, procurement, and infrastructure deployment cycles. A new approach to financial management in the cloud is required to realize business value and financial success. This approach is Cloud Financial Management, and builds capability across your organization by implementing organizational wide knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes.","Prisma Cloud System Admin",1638856525161,"Prisma Cloud System Admin",0,1638856525161
"Expenditure and usage awareness
","The increased flexibility and agility that the cloud enables encourages innovation and fast-paced development and deployment. It eliminates the manual processes and time associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures.

"Cost-effective resources","Using the appropriate instances and resources for your workload is key to cost savings. For example, a reporting process might take ﬁve hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.

"Manage demand and supply resources","When you move to the cloud, you pay only for what you need. You can supply resources to match the workload demand at the time they’re needed, this eliminates the need for costly and wasteful over provisioning. You can also modify the demand, using a throttle, buﬀer, or queue to smooth the demand and serve it with less resources resulting in a lower cost, or process it at a later time with a batch service.","Prisma Cloud System Admin",1638856525161,"Prisma Cloud System Admin",0,1638856525161
"Optimize over time
","As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective. As your requirements change, be aggressive in decommissioning resources, entire services, and systems that you no longer require.
